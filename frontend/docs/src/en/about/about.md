## Project Background

FastapiAdmin was born from a recurring pain in enterprise admin development: under the front-end/back-end separation architecture, even a simple CRUD page requires touching multiple directories, files, and technology stacks. The development experience is fragmented, and collaboration costs are high.

Traditional admin solutions (like Django Admin) are limited in functionality and hard to customize. Pure front-end templates (like AdminLTE, Ant Design Pro) lack backend support, requiring you to build the API layer from scratch. The market was missing a **truly out-of-the-box, full-stack, AI-capable** enterprise admin platform.

FastapiAdmin's mission: spin up a working MVP in 15-30 minutes; routine CRUD is auto-generated so the team can focus on what makes the product unique.

## Technical Philosophy

### ⚡ Full-Stack Async + High Performance

The backend uses FastAPI's native async/await architecture with Pydantic v2 auto-type validation and Redis caching for system performance from the ground up. The frontend is built with Vue3 + TypeScript for type-safe, component-driven development.

### 🧩 Vertical Slice Architecture

Instead of traditional layered architecture (Controller → Service → DAO), FastapiAdmin organizes code by business domain using Vertical Slice. Each module contains its own Controller, Service, Model, and Schema — zero coupling between modules. Multiple developers can work in parallel without conflicts, and extracting a module into a microservice is as simple as moving one directory.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Development

Starting from v2.0, the AI Code Generator allows you to select a database table and have AI automatically generate full CRUD code (Controller / Service / Model / Vue pages) — in practice this covers roughly 90% of routine CRUD, with the remaining 10% requiring customisation.

### 📱 Multi-Platform Delivery

Built on UniApp, one codebase generates H5, WeChat Mini Program, Alipay Mini Program, and native App simultaneously. The backend API layer naturally supports multi-platform reuse without duplicating interfaces.
